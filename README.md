# Conference Ticket Challenge From Frontend Mentor

This my my solution to the ticket challenge, it meets all the requirements from leting users know if the avatar uploaded is bigger than 500 kb to fitting on both desktop and mobile screens. Challenge was completed with TypeScript, React and CSS. I had trouble with matching certain styling such as the inputs' faint outline/border, I couldn't quite match the design required. Another area where I had trouble was with the sguiggly line background, I think the image wasn't able to stretch far enough(due to VW I believe).
